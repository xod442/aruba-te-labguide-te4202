# Lab 4 - Test the Policy  

## Lab Overview
Lab time:  15 minutes  

The spine leaf architecture provides for massive bandwidth between racks in the data center. Another reason for deploying a spine leaf is resiliency. The spine switches connect to leafs, the leafs, to the spines. The connections between them, are routed IP layer 3 links. They will not pass VLAN information. To get layer 2 traffic between the leafs, VXLAN must be used to create an overlay network.

VSX Configuration is being skipped in this workshop due to limited hardware availability, but it is always recommended to configure a high-availability setup for critical server workloads. Refer to our Validated Solutions Guide (VSG) to learn more:

You were _assigned a pod number_ at the start of the workshop. Add a zero in front of it and it becomes the _lab group number_. In the third octet of the IP address, start with the number 2 and add your lab group number to it. As an example, user1 = lab group 01 â€“ 3rd octet, 201. The AFC IP for lab group 01 would be 10.250.201.30
